# Automatic Text Summarizer
The project aims to build automatic text summarizer by implementing the abstractive and extractive summarization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for the abstractive summarization in this project [CNN-DailyMail dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail) is available on Kaggle.

## Code Files
* finetuning_bert_models.py: This file was used to fine tune the BERT2BERT model to our dataset.
* finetuning_t5_model.py: This file was used to fine tunne the t5 model to our dataset.
* summarization_gui.py : This file contains the code for GUI as well as the implementation of the Textrank algorithm.

## Report
The project report is available in report.pdf which describes the project and its results in detail.
